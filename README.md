####Background and Description####

Barking Owl came out of the need presented at a Hacks and Hackers Rochester (#hhroc) meet-up in Syracuse, NY.
A journalist expressed his need for a tool that would assist him in looking for key words within PDFs posted
to town websites, such as meeting minutes.

####Objective####

I wanted to make the code for this project as reusable as possible as I knew it had several parallels to other
work I had been doing and wanted to do in the future.  The solution was a architecture that would allow for 
significant scalability and extensibility.

####How to get started####

BarkingOwl is on the pypi network, thus it can be installed using pip:

    > pip install barkingowl
